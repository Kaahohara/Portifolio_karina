The project consists of an online book reservation system that allows users to reserve books in a virtual library. The system was developed using PHP, SQL, and CSS technologies.

The platform allows users to view the available book collection, including information about the title, author, and availability. Users can select the desired book and choose the date and time for pick-up and return.

The system also features a login area, where users can create an account to manage their bookings, loan history, and pending reservations. Security is ensured through password encryption and protection measures against SQL Injection attacks.

Additionally, the system has a specific area for library administrators, who can manage the registration of books, users, reservations, and loans. Administrators can add new books, check pending reservations, and manage the library's inventory.

The system is responsive and uses CSS to ensure a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

The implementation of the project involved creating an SQL database to store information about books, users, reservations, and loans. The PHP language was used to implement the booking functionality, user registration, login, registration management, and other system features.

In summary, this project offers users a simple and efficient way to make book reservations in a virtual library, while allowing administrators to manage book, user, reservation, and loan registrations using PHP, SQL, and CSS technologies to ensure security, quality, and a pleasant user experience.
